<h1>Welcome!</h1> 

<br>
<p>We develop and apply machine learning and statistical methods to study the genomics of complex diseases, with a particular interest in psychiatric disorders. We are especially interested in developing models for combining association evidence across multiple types of genomic data, such as gene expression and genotype data, and modeling prior biological pathways and networks for disentangling spurious from meaningful correlations.

<p>About Sara Mostafavi:</p>
  
<p>
I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Statistics and the Department of Medical Genetics, and an affiliate member of the Department of Computer Science, at University of British Columbia (UBC).
I am also a Canada Research Chair (<a href="http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/profile-eng.aspx?profileId=3457">CRC II</a>) in Computational Biology. 

Before arriving at UBC, I did my postdoctoral fellowship with <a href="http://dags.stanford.edu/index.html">Daphne Koller</a> at Stanford University. I got my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Toronto in 2011, working with <a href="http://www.morrislab.ca/">Quaid Morris</a>. 
My PhD <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~saram/thesis-v15r-march.pdf">thesis</a> was on integrating large-scale genomics and proteomics datasets to predict gene function.  
Check out <a href="http://www.genemania.org">GeneMANIA</a> to find out more about this project!

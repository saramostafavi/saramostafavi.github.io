Our lab’s research interest lies in developing and using machine learning and statistical techniques to study and understand the genetic basis of complex diseases, with a particular interest in psychiatric disorders. We are especially interested in developing models for combining association evidence across multiple genome-wide data sources, such as gene expression and genotype data, and modeling prior biological pathways and networks for disentangling spurious from meaningful correlations.

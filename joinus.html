      I am actively looking for PhD students interested in science at the intersection of ML and genomics. To join us, you can apply through the < a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/phd/admissions ">UW CSE application info page</a>.</li>

  <br>
      UW Computer Science and Engineering (<a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/">CSE</a>) is an amazing place to do research. 
      Check our Comp Bio faculty at CSE <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/fulltime/by-expertise#compbio">here</a>. 
      <br>
      Ongoing research in my group is focused on building sequence-to-function deep learning models for understanding gene regulation broadly, and to learn how to use sequence-to-function models to understand and predict susceptibility to genetic diseases.

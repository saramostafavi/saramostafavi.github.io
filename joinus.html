       I am looking for postdoc fellows interested in using machine learning approaches for understanding the genomics of neurodegeneration. The postdoc will collaborate with our neurology collaborators at Columbia and RUSH University to lead projects that build upon new datasets that are being generated as part of the AMP-AD consortium. </a>.
